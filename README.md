Here is a Hangman game

Classical rules, there's a hiden word,
your job is to discover it by guessing letters that could be in the word

If you discover the word, you win.
You can fail 5 letters, if you miss your -th shot, you lose

(Of course, in case you lose, you'll see which word was hiden ^^ )

Oh and, if you want to try with your own words, you can write them in the words.txt file

Enjoy !
